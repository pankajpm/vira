Define the Specifics of Your Design

Answer the iteration-specific design questions provided in the assignment.

Justify your choices based on practicality, efficiency, and alignment with course concepts.

**Establish Evaluation Metrics (From Lesson 7 in this module)**

What evaluation metrics will you use, and why?

Provide a brief explanation of your choices—how do these metrics help assess performance meaningfully?

**Consider Optimizations (From Lessons 3-5)**

Based on your use case, are there any potential optimizations that could improve performance?

If your use case needs to be run first before considering optimizations, mention it explicitly—some decisions require data-driven insights.

**Perform Cost, Latency & Effort Analysis** (From Lessons 3-5 for optimizations and Lesson 7 on Operational Metrics)

Estimate the cost, latency, and effort required for implementation:

Cost & Latency: Where is cost/latency creeping in? Consider factors such as:

Increased token usage (input/output)

Multiple LLM calls

Vector database storage and retrieval

Effort:

Categorize the effort level as low, medium, or high, based on what you've learned in class.

Justify your rating—why do you consider it high/medium/low?

Note: You don’t need exact numbers, simply explaining where costs and latency arise is valuable.

**Business & Compliance Considerations (Guardrails from here, or lookup online)**

What guardrails are necessary at this stage?

**Are there any compliance requirements relevant to your industry or use case?**
