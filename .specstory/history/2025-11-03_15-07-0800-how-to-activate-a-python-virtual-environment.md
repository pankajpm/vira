Run this in your terminal:

```zsh
source /Users/pankaj/projects/vira/.venv/bin/activate
```

It’ll switch you into the project’s virtualenv (prompt should gain a `.venv` prefix). If the command fails, double-check that the `.venv` directory exists and is fully set up.

- Activate the venv (`source /Users/pankaj/projects/vira/.venv/bin/activate`), then upgrade tooling so builds don’t break: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools`.
- Install runtime deps and register the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`.
- If you want the dev tooling (`pytest`, `ruff`, `black`, etc.), add the extra: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- All commands run from `/Users/pankaj/projects/vira`. If any pip step fails, let me know the error so we can fix it.

can I use uv to install?

**Explaining usage of uv pip for installation**

I'll confirm that using `uv pip` is a faster, drop-in replacement for pip and recommend activating the existing `.venv` first, then running `uv pip install -e .` for editable installs with dev extras if needed. I'll caution about matching Python versions and mention that upgrading pip or wheel separately isn’t necessary with uv, plus optionally suggest `uv sync` for locking dependencies, while including a simple install command for uv if missing—all presented concisely and clearly.</details></think>

Yes. After activating `.venv`, just replace `pip` with `uv pip`:

- `source /Users/pankaj/projects/vira/.venv/bin/activate`
- `uv pip install -e .`
- Optional dev tools: `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`

`uv pip` keeps hashes and caches aggressively, so installs are faster and deterministic. If `uv` isn’t installed yet, grab it once via `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.

**Analyzing dependency conflict and solutions**

I'm looking into why `uv pip install -e .` conflicts due to `langchainhub` version requirements—`pyproject` needs `>=0.1.22`, but only `<=0.1.21` seems available. I want to confirm if 0.1.22 is published (likely not) and suggest updating the dependency to `>=0.1.21` in `pyproject.toml` if features don't strictly require 0.1.22. Alternatively, I can recommend using a GitHub source or custom wheel if 0.1.22 is essential. I'll provide clear steps and commands to verify and fix this.</details></think>

Resolver failed because PyPI only exposes `langchainhub<=0.1.21`, while `pyproject.toml` pins `langchainhub>=0.1.22`. Pip would hit the same wall.

Fastest fix (unless you truly need 0.1.22 features): relax the requirement.

1. Edit `pyproject.toml` dependency to something like `langchainhub>=0.1.21,<0.2.0`.
2. Re-run `uv pip install -e .` (and `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` if you want the tooling).

If 0.1.22 is required, we’ll have to source it elsewhere—e.g., a Git/url dependency or our own wheel upload. Let me know which path you want and I’ll wire it up.
