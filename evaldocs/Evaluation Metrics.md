Enterprise AI Evaluation Metrics: Use Cases and Applications



1. Response Quality Metrics


1.1 Exact Match: Word Matching
Description: Checks if the generated response exactly matches a reference response.

Required Data: Ideal responses, model-generated responses

When to Use: When responses follow strict formats like predefined templates or structured data, such as dates, times, addresses, invoice numbers, or fixed categories.

How to Use: Use the equals heuristic metric from Comet’s heuristic metrics.



Example Use Cases:
Invoice Processing: Extracting exact invoice numbers, dates, or order IDs.

Medical Record Matching: Ensuring medical test results match database records.

LLM-based Classification in Workflow Agents: For predicting “yes”/“no” decisions or categorical routing (e.g., high/medium/low priority) in automated systems.



1.2 Fuzzy Match: Contains/Regex/Levenshtein
Description: Measures similarity by checking partial matches using substring search (Contains), pattern matching (Regex), or character-level edits (Levenshtein distance).

Required Data: Ideal responses, model-generated responses

When to Use: When strict exact matching isn’t needed, but the response must contain essential terms or be close to the reference. Best for structured fields where minor variations are acceptable, such as names, email addresses, product IDs, or ticket numbers.

Contains: Checks if a key term is present in the response.

Regex: Ensures responses match predefined patterns (e.g., emails, phone numbers).

Levenshtein Distance: Measures how many small edits (insertions, deletions, swaps) are needed to match two strings, useful for typos and OCR errors.

How to Use: Use the required metric from Comet’s heuristic metrics.

Example Use Cases:

Customer Support Ticket Matching (Regex)

Ensures AI-generated case numbers match a standard format (e.g., TICKET-12345 or SUP-2024-001).

Regex ensures responses conform to expected patterns while allowing format variations.

Product Search & Autocomplete (Contains & Levenshtein)

Allows slight variations in product names (e.g., "iPhone14 ProMax" vs. "iPhone 14 Pro Max").

Contains ensures key terms appear, while Levenshtein allows minor typos.

Email & Phone Number Validation (Regex)

Ensures AI correctly identifies and formats email addresses (user@example.com) and phone numbers (+1-234-567-8901).

Regex ensures correct structure while ignoring minor spacing or symbol variations.

OCR & Text Extraction (Levenshtein)

Matches scanned invoice IDs even with minor OCR errors (e.g., "INV-2024-001" vs. "INV2024 001").

Levenshtein helps correct small errors from OCR processing.

Name Matching in CRM Systems (Levenshtein & Contains)

Recognizes similar names despite typos (e.g., "Jonathon" vs. "Jonathan").

Levenshtein corrects minor spelling mistakes, while Contains ensures key parts of the name are present.






1.3 Fuzzy Match:BLEU/ROUGE
Description: Measures similarity between generated and reference responses using n-gram overlap (matching word sequences). BLEU is commonly used for machine translation, while ROUGE is used for summarization.

Required Data: Ideal responses, model-generated responses

When to Use:For shorter responses (under 50-60 words) where some word overlap is required but not exact matching. BLEU/ROUGE is not ideal for long-form content because it focuses on token overlap rather than deep semantic meaning.

How to Use:Use sentenceBLEU or CorpusBLEU from Comet’s heuristic metrics.

Example Use Cases:
Chatbots & Virtual Assistants

Ensures AI-generated customer support responses contain the right key terms.

Example:

Reference: "You can reset your password by clicking ‘Forgot Password’ on the login page."

AI response: "Click ‘Forgot Password’ to reset your password."

Why? Ensures partial alignment while allowing minor phrasing changes.

FAQ Response Generation

Checks if AI-generated FAQ answers retain key information without being word-for-word identical.

Example:

Reference: "Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after approval."

AI response: "Processing a refund takes 5 to 7 days after it's approved."





1.4 Semantic Match:BERTScore
Description: Uses BERT (an AI model) embeddings to compare generated and reference responses by calculating cosine similarity between their embeddings. This evaluates meaning rather than exact word matching.

Required Data:Ideal responses, model-generated responses, and BERT embeddings of both.

When to Use: When semantic similarity matters more than exact wording, such as in conversational AI, search engines, and summarization tasks. BERTScore should also be used for shorter responses (<50-60 words), but unlike BLEU/ROUGE, it can also be used when words don't match exactly

How to Use: Compute using the BERTScore library.

Example Use Cases:
Conversational AI & Chatbots

Checks if AI-generated customer support answers preserve meaning despite rewording.

Example:

Reference: "You can request a refund by visiting the payments section."

AI response: "Go to the payments page to initiate a refund request."

Search Query Matching

Ensures retrieved search results match the user’s intent, even if keywords differ.

Example:

Query: "How to improve cloud security?"

Matched Document: "Best practices for securing cloud storage."



1.5 LLM Judge: Any LLM (Prompted for Evaluation)
Description: Uses an LLM to rate responses based on predefined criteria such as coherence, fluency, factual accuracy, or response relevance along specific dimensions.

Required Data: Model-generated responses; optionally, an ideal response for reference, LLM judges can just be prompted to provide metrics even if ideal response is not available. LLM judges are more suitable if you have longer responses to evaluate

When to Use: For evaluating subjective qualities or contextual appropriateness.

How to Use: By using LLM APIs prompted for evaluation

Example Use Cases (if an ideal response is NOT present):
HR Response Generation (LLM Judge - No Ideal Response)

Ensures AI-generated HR emails maintain professionalism.

Example: AI-generated job offer emails should be polite and follow HR guidelines.

Customer Service Automation (LLM Judge - No Ideal Response)

Checks if AI-generated responses are detailed and well-structured based on predefined criteria.

Example: AI support replies should be concise, polite, and informative while answering customer concerns.

AI-Generated Blog Writing (LLM Judge - No Ideal Response)

Evaluates coherence, readability, and engagement in AI-written articles.

Example: AI-generated tech blogs should have clear, well-structured paragraphs and engaging language.



Example Use Cases (if an ideal response IS present):
Legal Document Review (LLM Judge - With Ideal Response)

Ensures AI-generated legal summaries retain key contractual details.

Example: Checking if an AI-generated summary of a NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) captures essential clauses.

AI-Generated Medical Summaries (LLM Judge - With Ideal Response)

Ensures AI-generated patient reports align with a doctor-reviewed reference.

Example: AI should correctly summarize lab results or diagnosis reports without introducing errors.

Policy Compliance Checks (LLM Judge - With Ideal Response)

AI-generated policy documents should match company guidelines and avoid misinterpretations.

Example: AI drafts a workplace privacy policy, and an LLM evaluates if it aligns with company HR standards.

3.2 Answer Relevance (LLM Judge)
Description: Evaluates whether the generated response directly answers the user’s question instead of being vague or off-topic.

Required Data: Generated response, user query

When to Use: When AI-generated responses must stay focused on the user’s specific request.

How to Use: Use LLM judges or semantic similarity models to compare the response to the expected intent. Check out RAG metrics in Comet Opik

Example Use Cases:
HR Chatbots: When an employee asks, “How many PTO days do I have left?”, AI should provide a number—not general leave policy info.

Medical AI Assistants: A doctor asking for "side effects of Drug X" should not receive a broad pharmaceutical history of Drug X.

Customer Support AI: If a user asks, “Can I get a refund for a defective product?”, AI should not just repeat the refund policy—it should confirm eligibility.



3.3 Answer Correctness (LLM Judge)
Description: Ensures that AI-generated content is factually correct, preventing misinformation.

Required Data: Generated response, external knowledge sources (fact-checking datasets or human annotations)

When to Use: When factual accuracy is critical, such as in finance, healthcare, or legal applications.
